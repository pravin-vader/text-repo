This error means that your Git repository doesn't have a remote named origin configured — so when you try git pull origin main, Git has no idea where to pull from.

Step 1: Check if a remote is set

git remote -v

Step 2: Add the remote
You’ll need to add the remote manually. If you have the repository URL

git remote add origin <repository-URL>

 Step 3: Fetch and set upstream
git fetch origin
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main

Now you can pull as usual:
git pull



Finally Check if a remote is set
git remote -v


Thank you and happy learning
